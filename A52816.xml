            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God hath ſhot three Arrows, (as in <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.21, 22.) three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> Arrows all, not to <hi>wound</hi> us but to <hi>warn</hi> us, that the intentions of <hi>Bloody MEN</hi> were for our utter deſtruction. Thus when <hi>Mordecai</hi> was Informed, or [<hi>Jadang,</hi> Hebr.] came to know of the bloody Decree, this was Gods means to break the Neck of cruel <hi>Haman</hi>'s wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſign, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus alſo the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſcovery of the Powder Plot (in this Land) was (in Gods hand) the marvellous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of it: And ſurely 'twas no bad Argument, which <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Mother uſed to his Father <hi>Manoah, If God would have deſtroyed us, he would never have diſcovered theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, Judg.</hi> 13.23.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Preſaging Providence is, <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the Mother of Deſtruction:</hi> (God forbid it ſhould be amongſt us, <hi>ſicollidimur, frangimur,</hi> if we claſh we break,) but now (praiſed be God) 'tis found among our Enemies: The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Babel</hi>-Builders is divided and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; oh how do Prieſts and Jeſuits now divide and diſcover Prieſts and Jeſuits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95838:6"/>Hereby their Nimrods or cruel Hunters with all their curſed Chamites, are diſperſed from their <hi>Babel</hi>-Building, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. Our Lord ſaith, <hi>If Satans Kingdom be divided againſt it ſelf it cannot poſſibly ſtand, Matth.</hi> 12.25, 26.</p>
            <p>The third Preſaging Providence is, <hi>A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hath a Preſaging Tendency to the End.</hi> To this <hi>Zereſh</hi> (<hi>Haman</hi>'s Wife, and probably a prudent Woman) ſpoke ſhrowdly and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, ſaying: <hi>If</hi> Mordecai <hi>be of the Seed of the Jews before whom thou haſt begun to fall; thou ſhalt not be able to ſtand but thou ſhalt ſurely fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Eſth.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Principium per media tendit ad finem: Haman</hi> was but barely begun to fall a little below <hi>Mordecai</hi> in honour. Hence his final Fall was foretold, either by <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtinct as the <hi>Sybils</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> or only by <hi>Humane</hi> Prudence, drawing this notable Concluſion from the common cuſtom of Riſing and Falling Favourites: And may not we inferr alſo, that ſeeing ſome of Gods and the Kingdoms Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have certainly <hi>begun to fall</hi> before you (the true <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s of our day) they ſhall not be able to ſtand, but ſhall ſurely fall before us: Oh that it may be a final and an irrecoverable Fall.</p>
            <p>The fourth Preſaging Providence is, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Proteſtants peaceably diſſenting, is much turned into Juſtice upon Papiſts bloodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning:</hi> Whereby the Lord intimates, he will <hi>perform</hi> with his <hi>Hand</hi> what he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> with his <hi>Mouth,</hi> to wit, of taking the Cup of
<pb facs="tcp:95838:6"/>Trembling out of the hand of <hi>Sion,</hi> and of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into the hand of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.17, 22, 23.) to make her drink the very dregs of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall drink not only unto drunkenneſs but alſo unto madneſs, ſhe ſhall <hi>Spue and Fall and riſe no more. Jer.</hi> 25.18, 21.</p>
            <p>The fifth Preſaging Providence is, <hi>A chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Word:</hi> This was a Praeſage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to Gods Triary, the three Nobles of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that the Kings <hi>Word</hi> or Counſel was changed; they had been taken into the Kings Council, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.20. and 2.49. but afterwards were impeached and caſt into the Furnace: Thoſe Servants of the moſt High God, were not only delivered, but promoted to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and greater Honours, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.28, 30. In concurrence herewith, the Kings Word (or Counſel) is now changed, ſome Perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (who have been highly honoured, but afterwards Impeached and caſt into the Tower) are again Promoted to be of the Privy Council, and one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as another <hi>Daniel</hi>) to be Preſident thereof: The Riſing of New Favourites is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Fall of Old ones, as <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s was of <hi>Haman</hi>'s. No doubt the ſame God that hath changed <hi>the Kings Word</hi> (or Counſel) can influence his Heart as he did the Heart of <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 1.1. <hi>The Kings Heart is in the Hand of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 21.1. to turn it as eaſily as the Ploughman doth his Water-courſe with his Paddle, or the Gardiner with his hand.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95838:7"/>
            <p>The ſixth Preſaging Providence is, <hi>The migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Turn which is wrought upon the Spirit of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in General:</hi> 'Tis expreſly ſaid, that the [<hi>Sibbah</hi> hebr.] <hi>Circuit, Revolution,</hi> or <hi>turning about</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of</hi> the Ten Tribes was <hi>from the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.15. As the Heart of the King ſo the Hearts of the Kingdom are in the Hand of the Lord, and he ordereth all diſorders, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.23. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.19, 22. There is a Cry in our Ears at this day, <hi>Oh Wheel!</hi> And <hi>there is a Wheel within a Wheel; Ezek.</hi> 10.10, 13. 'tis the Father of Spirits that ſets on or takes off the Spirits of People, and <hi>vox Populi eſt vox Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Summ up all, the ſeventh and laſt Preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Providence is, <hi>God hath put his Hand to the Plough, and he will not look back, Luke</hi> 9. 62. The Wheel (of Providence) goes <hi>ſtreight forward,</hi> and returns not as it goes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.9, 12, 17. <hi>But to the Place whither the Head looks, the Wheels fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: They turned not as they went, Ezek.</hi> 10.11. God poſitively Proteſteth, <hi>When I begin I will alſo make an end,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.12. When he once begins his Execution of Juſtice, <hi>[quod Verbis minatur, reipſa praeſtabit,]</hi> he will perform with his Hand what his Mouth hath ſpoken, and go through ſtitch with his Work, he will neither dally nor deſiſt till it be done; and aſſuredly none can deny, but the Great God hath begun this his Great Work (called <hi>his ſtrange Work, Iſa.</hi> 28.21.) and God will <hi>Accompliſh his Fury, Ezek.</hi> 5.13. for <hi>All his Works are perfect, Deut.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95838:7"/>32.4. He is not like the fooliſh Builder in the Goſpel, that <hi>lays the Foundation and hath not wherewith to finiſh, Like</hi> 14.28, 30. But the <hi>good Work that God hath begun, he will perform it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1.6. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the pauſes that Providence makes in its Paſſage and Progreſs, ſuch are but as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Parentheſe's</hi> which never interrupt (but rather Illuſtrate) the Sence of a Sentence. Sometimes 'tis the Method of Providence (in order to the fulfilling of Promiſes) to <hi>ſtep back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> after he was Anointed the firſt time by <hi>Samuel,</hi> was brought to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Court to drive away the Evil Spirit from <hi>Saul,</hi> which could not but give him ſome hope of the Crown God had promiſed him by <hi>Samuel,</hi> yet after this was <hi>David</hi> brought thence to his Country Life of being a Shepherd. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Gods Providence, as the Battering Ram (that ſteps backward) comes on with greater Force again. Now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Having all theſe Preſaging Providences (humbly Propoſed, not peremptorily and Dictator like Impoſed) for your Encouragement; <hi>Ariſe and be doing for the Lord is with you,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.16. The <hi>ſound of Gods goings is gone out before you,</hi> (<hi>the Footſteps of his Anointed, Pſal.</hi> 89.51.) and you may hear an hurrying noiſe upon the very tops of thoſe tall Cedats (you have impeached) in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; therefore now muſt you up and at it; and

That the Lord may give you the Gift of Miracles, not only for Removing thoſe great Mountains that lye in your way, but alſo to caſt out thoſe ſeven Unclean Spirits (mentioned in this Treatiſe) out of the Land, ſo as never to return upon us any more, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.25. That God may be <hi>your Arm every Morning, Iſa.</hi> 33.2: And that the Arms of your Hands may be ſtrong by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Everlaſting God of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.24. and that your Bow may abide in ſtrength, until you have ſhot the Arrows of <hi>England</hi>'s Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.17.

            <p n="50">50. Yea, there is a ſuperſtitious worſhip of the true God (as well as of falſe Gods) when man either chuſes a worſhip for God, or thoſe

            <p n="51">51 This ſuperſtitions worſhip of God is, when a certain ſingular force and efficacy is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed <hi>(ex opere operato)</hi> to external Rites pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed of God: As when a power of driving away Devils and healing of Diſeaſes, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ſome words repeated, or writings hung about the Neck; whereas thoſe words and writings have no ſuch power, neither from their own Nature nor from any divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="52">52. To aſcribe that to any thing, which it hath no natural power unto, nor divinely ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for, is notorious.

            <p n="56">56. Superſtition is a being righteous (or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious) overmuch, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.16. (as Atheiſm is a being righteous (or religious) over little;) as when men do hot only believe that Chriſt is our ſatisfaction for ſin, but alſo there is need of Alms, Prayers, Faſtings, Vows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſatisfie for our ſins; this is an addition of our own merit to the merit of Chriſt, as if the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt were not complete enough without the beggarly Eeke of our filthy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. This nimiety or exceſs is found in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p n="57">57. <hi>Tertullian</hi> condemns all things to be <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuae obſervationis, et ſuperſtitioni deputanda, quae fine ullius Dominici aut Apoſtolici praecepti autorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te facta ſunt.

            <p n="58">58.

            <p n="59">59.

            <p n="60">60.

            <p n="61">61. Having now made this large diſcovery of this right-hand Enemy of the true Religion, it remains that I make known where this Thief hath his principal Reſidence, that would ſteal away from us our Religion, (which is a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of Heaven, and the beauty of all the Kingdoms of the Earth) and would put ſuch a cheat upon us, as <hi>Michael</hi> did upon <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.12, 13. in diſmiſſing <hi>David</hi> and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Image (that was bed-rid in his ſtead<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Suppoſed to be the <hi>Teraphim</hi> that was made in the ſhape of a man: Hebr. <hi>Teraphim</hi> ſignifies Images.</note>

IN my diſſwaſive from Popery, I ſhall I. ſhow in general, the ſeven wretched Properties of the Romiſh Faith, for which it may not be embraced but rather to be abhorred. 1. Of the firſt, The Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a ſuperſtitious Religion: 'tis made up of a worſhip altogether <hi>ſupra ſtatutum,</hi> as ſundry intimations hereof (afore mentioned) do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly illuſtrate: 'tis ſo notoriouſly clogg'd with Ceremonies of Humane invention, (while the <hi>Magnalia legis</hi> lay neglected) that while they write up ſervice, God writes up ſin; ſaying, <hi>who requir'd thoſe things at your hands? Iſa.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Superſtition ſprung up betimes in the Church of <hi>Rome; Satan</hi> ſowed Tares (ſo he is called, <hi>ſuperſeminator</hi>) very early. Many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Doctrines from this <hi>ſuperſeminator</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95838:22"/>did the Biſhops of <hi>Reme</hi> bring into the Church in the firſt ſix hundred years after Chriſt; which ſignifies that Antichriſt was then growing up there until the time of his full maturity for his Revelation in that place.</p>
               <p n="66">66. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Firſt (Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) brought in the mingling of water with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Wine, and of Salt with water for benediction (agreeable to the Pagans) about 112th year after Chriſt; After him about 20 years comes <hi>Teleſphorus,</hi> and ordained a Lent-Faſt for ſeven weeks, about the year 130 after Chriſt; and about the year of Chriſt 144. <hi>Pius</hi> the firſt appoints the celebration of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon the Lords day.</p>
               <p n="67">67. About the year of Chriſt 159. the (ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Prieſts Crowns was brought into the Church by <hi>Anicetus</hi> (the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) to whom <hi>Polycarp</hi> came, about compoſing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences concerning the Celebration of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> becauſe it was pretended that the celebrating of it on Sunday,<note n="(y)" place="bottom">The diſſenters were called Quartadecimani.</note> as they called it, one <hi>Hermes</hi> received by Revelation from an Angel in a Shepherds habit: This having of Crowns was a ſuperſtitious Cuſtom, derived from the practice of the Aegyptian Prieſts of <hi>Iſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="68">68. This ſuperſtitious Shaving was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by divers of the Fathers, as <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alex. Paedagog. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Optatus Contra Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menionem

About the year of Chriſt 221. were alſo introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church the Faſts of four times, by <hi>Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the firſt; and about ſix years after, ſilver Cups were brought into the Celebration of the Supper by Pope <hi>

Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> appoints Divine Service to be Celebrated upon the Sepulchres of Martyrs: About five years after, Pope <hi>Eutychianus</hi> brings in the Benediction of the fruits of the Earth upon the Altar; as if with the Manichees they had held them unclean, until they were thus purified.</p>
               <p n="70">70. This Pope <hi>Eutychianus</hi> (the <hi>Tuſcan</hi>) is ſaid to bring in that cuſtom, that no Martyr ſhould be buried but in the Veſtment called <hi>Palmatica,</hi> and a Purple Hood. Thus Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition began to grow unto ſome ſtrength in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> betimes, and that not only in matters of Ceremony but alſo of Doctrine, for then began Temples to be built to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, to the great diſhonour of God in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages.</p>

               <p n="72">72. In the year 336.

               <p n="75">75. After the ſixth Century commenced, Superſtition came not by drops, as before, but whole floods of it, and that in Doctrine too as well as Ceremony: Then entred in Invocation of Saints, Prayer for the dead, and Purgaory; the Doctrine of Juſtification by the merit of works, of Traditions, of worſhipping Reliques and Images, of the Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which be <hi>ſupra Statutum.</hi>

'Tis a very honourable undertaking of Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> (and other Reconcilers to <hi>Rome</hi>) to wipe the Whores mouth of this Sin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: But when thoſe men have ſaid all they can, they can never unſay what the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Religion have ſaid to prove it; as Rivers, the nearer they come to the Sea; the more brackiſh taſt have they; ſo thoſe men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo near the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> diſcover but a brackiſh Spirit.</p>

Her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry in worſhipping of Images, Reliques, Croſſes and the Hoſt, is altogether as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as that of the Pagans.</p>

               <p n="82">82. But Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> more ſolidly and fully ſays, that the Romiſh Religion (which he calls the great Italian <hi>Diana</hi>) is Idolatrous in many reſpects<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Perk. Idolatry of laſt times, pag. <hi>673.1. Vol.</hi>

               <p n="84">84. The ſecond Reſpect, wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Idolatrous, is her worſhipping God otherwiſe and by other means than he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Word; as in Images, Crucifixes, Hoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeeing ſpiritual Adoration is now only required, <hi>John</hi> 4.21, 22, 23.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

                  </note> And that worſhip which is tyed to either place or thing on Earth, is by that Scripture utterly abodiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forbidden.

               <p n="86">86. There is Idolatry of the Firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and Idolatry of the ſecond; when men eſteem and adore any thing for God, which is not the true God, this is Idolatry againſt the Firſt Commandment: But when the True God is indeed worſhipped, but he is worſhipped in Images, in Saints and Angels, and all falſe <hi>Mediums,</hi> and not by means of Gods own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing; this is Idolatry againſt the ſecond, and there is great Affinity between them.</p>
               <p n="87">87. 'Tis ſaid 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.17. <hi>The People ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the high places, yet to the Lord their God.</hi> Their Sacrificing formerly was Idolatry againſt the firſt Command, but now 'twas Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry againſt the ſecond; as failing and falling ſhort of the true manner in worſhipping the true God.

               </p>
               <p n="88">88. Their Sacrificing, now, in the high places, yet to the Lord; was, in general, of the ſame kind, with their ſacrificing (formerly) in thoſe high places to <hi>Baal.</hi> The ſcope of the ſecond Command is to condemn all Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip as Idolatry, which is not warranted by the word of God. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not do ſo to the Lord thy God:</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, thou ſhalt not do ſo to thoſe Idols, but not ſo in that manner to the true God, as they did to their Idols. <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31.</p>
               <p n="89">89. <hi>Polanus</hi> in his <hi>Syntagni. Theolig. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. makes two ſorts of Idolatry: The 1. he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95838:27"/>calls <hi>tectior et ſubtilior;</hi> when the true God is indeed worſhiped, but with another manner of worſhip than he hath commanded himſelf, to be worſhipped in his word; as thoſe that worſhip God by Statues and Images are idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, although they deny <hi>Centies millies</hi> (ſays he) that they worſhip any thing beſide the true God.</p>
               <p n="90">90. The ſecond ſort of Idolatry, which he calls <hi>Craſſior et Apertior,</hi> is, when any thing is religiouſly worſhipped for the true God, which is not God: This was the Idolatry of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, worſhipping Devils, Men, and other Creatures with religious worſhip; and this is (ſaith he) the Idolatry of the Papiſts, in their religious worſhipping of not only Saints and Angels, (yea the very Images or Statues of them) but alſo of the Croſs, Reliques, yea of thoſe that were,</p>
               <q>Nequaquam Sancti aut nunquam in rerum Naturâ.</q>
               <p n="91">91. If this be ſo, that this groſſer ſort of Idolatry be found in the Romiſh Church, how much more that which is ſubtiler and of a finer ſpun thread, pretending they worſhip God in their Images; as the worſhipping of <hi>Jehovah</hi> by or in the golden Calf (which <hi>Aaron</hi> made in the Wilderneſs) was plain Idolatry: In like manner as the worſhipping of God by the two Golden Calves (that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up at <hi>Dan</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95838:27"/>
                  <hi>Bethel</hi>) was flat Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="92">92. Although we find <hi>Aaron</hi> pretended that by or in that Calf they worſhipped <hi>Jehovah;</hi> that brought them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt.

               <p n="93">93. Suppoſe there be truth in Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Notion, that the Golden Calf in the Wilderneſs was made in the Figure of a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub, (after appointed to be in the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.18. and of which, he ſays, <hi>Aaron</hi> might then have ſome intimation) compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.10. with 10.14. yet could not <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly ſtupid as to believe, that either the Golden Cherub or Calf wrought all thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and brought them thence.</p>
               <p n="94">94. And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made the ſame pretence in his Calves, the ſame Phraſe being uſed, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.28. [<hi>Behold! thy Gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt.] meaning a repreſentation of the true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as if he drew them not to worſhip any other God, than the God of their Fathers, which brought them (as his Redeemed People) out of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Bondage, for by this Title God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.5, 6. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.36. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.10.</p>

               <p n="95">95. And as <hi>Iſrael</hi> learnt this abomination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Aegyptians, (among whom they had ſo long lived) and where the Idol <hi>Apis</hi> was worſhiped in the ſhape of an Oxe; and <hi>Thus,</hi> 'tis ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, they changed their glory,</hi> (to wit, their God that redeemed them out of <hi>Aegypt</hi>) <hi>into the ſimilitude of an Ox that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Graſs, Pſal</hi> 106.19, 20. So <hi>Jeroboam</hi> brought his Calf-making from <hi>Aegypt</hi> too, where he had lately lived, 1 <hi>Kin..</hi> 11.40.</p>
               <p n="96">96. Although thoſe worſhippers of the Calves (both in <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s time) probably pretended, that they did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Calf, but God in the Calf; (as did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.16, 29. <hi>In having zeal for the Lord, yet adhering to</hi> Jeroboam's <hi>Calves</hi>) their worſhip being not (as ſome excuſe it) by any means terminative in the Creature before their eyes; yet are they expreſly called Idolaters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7.</p>
               <p n="97">97. And though the Idolatry of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, was indeed of a deeper dye than the Idolatry of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> becauſe it was againſt greater means and mercies; the Ten Tribes under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> had not upon their hearts ſuch a freſh taſt of Deliverance from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they had not the pillar of Glory, nor the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Gods Preſence; they had not a <hi>Moſes</hi> that was faithful in all the houſe of God, <hi>only Prieſts of the baſeſt of the People,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin</hi> 13, 33. yet the Idolatry of <hi>Rome</hi> is worſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="100">100. Thus we ſee the plea of the Romiſh Church for her worſhipping God in Images, (from the Iſraelites worſhipping God in the Calves) falls to the ground, and to worſhip God in, at, or before an Image is Idolatry; 'tis a worſhipping of the true God in a falſe manner: For 1. Such binds Gods Preſence and Influence of Grace to ſuch places as God never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95838:29"/>bound his preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto. 2. There is neither precept nor promiſe for it. 3. 'Tis expreſly forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="101">101. And though they ſay we intend not to worſhip the Image, but God in the Image; this is not a ſufficient <hi>ſalvo,</hi> for the Iſraelites wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped not the Calf but God in the Calf, yet are they ſaid to worſhip the Molten Calf, and to ſacrifice unto it in Gods account. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.8.

               <p n="102">102. The Heathens in their Idolatry had ſuch a meaning as this, (as <hi>Arnobius contra gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes lib.</hi> 6. tells us) <hi>Deos per ſimulachra veneramur,</hi> juſt ſaying as the Papiſts ſay at this day; The Athenians and other Gentiles worſhiped the true God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.23. yet by falſe <hi>mediums</hi> and meanings; and if this worſhipping the true God falſely be not Idolatry, there hath been little in the World.</p>
               <p n="103">103. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> tells us, that the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription upon the Altar mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.23. was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="104">104. But to leave the Idolatry of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, I have conſulted <hi>Joſephus</hi> about that of the Jews in the days of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who ſays that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> worſhiped God in his Calves, yet was he eſteemed an Idolater:<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Joſephus Antiqu. lib. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>3, 4.</hi>
                  </note> He brings in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſpeaking thus, [God is in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in my two Temples at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> as well as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have Conſecrated two Golden Calves in thoſe two places, to the end that ye may adore God.] He doth not ſay, <hi>[Adore my Calves.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="105">105. Yet when <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Wife went to the Prophet about their ſick Son; the Prophet (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays) bids her tell <hi>Jeroboam</hi> from God, that he ſhould be rooted up for honouring his new Gods, and his people ſhould be carried Captive for adoring thoſe Gods that he had forged: But more plainly and fully, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.9. <hi>Thou haſt made thee other Gods,</hi> [not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of God] though he accounted them ſo, yet God did not ſo account of them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95838:30"/>but was provoked to anger by them; for no ſin provokes God more to anger than Idolatry.</p>

'Tis true, the Patrons of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion do affirm, that ſome in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be ſaved, to wit, ſuch as do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Salvation by Chriſt and not by the merit of <hi>their own works,</hi> as the <hi>Trent</hi> Papiſts do: None (amongſt the Judicious) ever taught, that a Papiſt univerſally owning the <hi>Trent</hi> Faith and Religion (living and dying ſo) could be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="142">142. The Romaniſts (indeed) make ſome advantage of our charitable Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; ſaying, that ſome of our Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion acknowledg, that the Papiſts hold all things neceſſary to Salvation, then it will follow by neceſſary conſequence, that a Papiſt <hi>(quà talis)</hi> may be ſaved. They eſpecially improve that ſaying of <hi>Luther,</hi> [that the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of true Faith remains yet in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] inferring from thence, that we take only the Shell of Religion.</p>

               <p n="144">144. But the Learned Dr. thus anſwered the Argument of this Planetick Sophiſter: 1. That argues not that the Papiſts have more verity, but that we (Proteſtants) have more Charity. 2.

               <p n="145">145. Let the Romaniſts obferve, that our own Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (that <hi>Romaniſtarum malleus</hi>) hath ſolidly proved, that a Papiſt cannot go beyond a Reprobate; yea, and <hi>Hunnius</hi> hath writ a book to prove them no Chriſtians, and 'tis the concurring Opinion of all our profoundeſt Writers, that where Popery prevaileth againſt the practical points of Chriſtianity, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant (even) in Fundamentals, there can be no Salvation for ſuch without Converſion.</p>

               <p n="265">265.

               <p n="273">273. But as a <hi>Compendium</hi> of all kind of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh cruelty, the Spaniſh Inquiſition was invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dominicans, at firſt erected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Jews and Moors, but ſoon turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faithful Servants of Chriſt for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Goſpel, whom the Romaniſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors brought to their Rack, ſtanding in a dark Dungeon under ground, with many doors to paſs through to drown the ſhrieks of the Tormented: The Tormentor (when Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are lighted) comes diſguiſed like a Devil, to terrifie the more (with his black Vizard) the tormented Soul.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:95838:63"/>
               <p n="274">274. The firſt kind of torment in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, is the Jibbet to which they carry men and women naked, not allowing them either Shirt or Smock (as if that could hinder the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Rack from tormenting them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) the Tormentors binding their hands with a Cord eight or ten times about (each time harder than other) and their Thumbs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hard with a ſmall line, ſo both hands and Thumbs are faſtned to a Pully which hangs on the Jibbet, then have they great Bolts on their heels, and between their Feet certain weights of Iron hung upon thoſe Bolts, and ſo are hoiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
               <p n="275">275. The poor tormented Soul hanging in this woful extremity, the Inquiſitors bids them to accuſe themſelves and all other Hereticks they know of: Then they Command him or her to be hoiſed up higher to the very Beam, till their Heads touch the Pully; and having hung thus a good while, the Inquiſitors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to let them down again, and twice as much weight to be faſtned to their heels, and ſo to hoiſe them up again to the Pully: Then they bid the Executioner ſlip the Rope, (that they may fall down with great force) and in the mid way to ſtop them, which together with the Strappado (they give them then) Rends all their Joynts aſunder.</p>
               <p n="276">276. And if they ſtill remain Conſtant, ſo inhumane and unparallel'd is their Popiſh cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95838:64"/>that they add more weight to their heels the third time, and the poor Wretch (already half dead) is hoiſted up again, and railingly call'd a Dog and an Heretick; and if in all thoſe pangs they cry out for Aſſiſtance to Chriſt, for whoſe ſake they are thus miſerably tormented, then theſe Romiſh Scoffers bids, [Let Chriſt alone, and tell them the truth, what a crying out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt makeſt thou? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="277">277. Thoſe Torments are uſually exerciſed upon them for three hours together, after all which to affright the poor Creature the more, they ask the Jaylor if his other Torments be ready, telling them that all this is but a flea-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in compariſon of what is yet to be ſuffer'd: Then the Jaylor ſets their Joynts as well as he can, and drags them away by their Legs or Arms moſt barbarouſly to Priſon, and when the Aching of their Joynts be moſt painful, then are they brought to the Rack again, where the Executioner appears like a Devil.</p>
               <p n="278">278. If they ſtill remain conſtant, they are again ſtripp'd and hoiſted up with weights at their heels as before; beſides which they add another cruel Torment, to wit, as they hang at the Pully, thoſe Tormeutors bind their Thighs together, and Legs about the Calf with a ſmall ſtrong Cord; and with a ſhort piece of wood, they twiſt the Cord till it be ſhrunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fleſh out of ſight, and in this terrible torment they let the tormented lie for two or three hours.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:95838:64"/>
               <p n="279">279. And as if all this were too little, they proceed to another kind of Torture (called <hi>Aſelli</hi> or the Trough) which is a piece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſomewhat hollowed on the top like a Trough, about the middle whereof there is a ſharp bar going acroſs, whereon a mans back reſteth, that it cannot go to the bottom; and 'tis placed ſo that his heels ſhall lye higher than his head; then is the naked Party laid thereon, his Arms, Thighs, and Legs bound with Cords.</p>
               <p n="280">280. Thoſe binding Cords are both ſmall and ſtrong, and wreſted with ſhort Truncheons till they pierce almoſt to the very bone; then they take a ſine Lawn Cloth, laying it upon the mouth of him or her thus tortured; (as they lye upright on their back) ſo that it may ſtop the Noſtrils alſo. Then this barbarous Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner pours down a long ſtream of water like a Thread from on high, which drives the Cloth into the Throat of the Tormented, and puts them into as great an Agony as any endure in the pains of death.</p>
               <p n="281">281. For in this Torture they cannot draw their breath, the water ſtopping their Mouth and the Cloth their Noſtrils; ſo that when the Cloth is drawn out of the bottom of the Throat it brings out blood with it, and one would think tears out the very Bowels: This is iterated as oft as the Inquiſitors pleaſe, and as if this were not ſtill cruelty ſavage enough,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95838:65"/>they take a pan of burning Charcoal and ſet it juſt over againſt the Soles of the Parties Feet, juſt before he goes to Rack, and that the Fire may have more force upon them they baſt them with Lard or Bacon.</p>
               <p n="282">282. Laſtly, to fill up their Ephah with matchleſs bloody-mindedneſs; if thoſe tortured ones will not ſtill deny the truth, they condemn them; and attiring them in Sambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito's, (which is a long Garment painted all over with<note n="(y)" place="bottom">See the Book called [The diſcovery of the Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,] out of which <hi>Mr. Clark</hi> Collects his deſcription of it.</note> ugly Devils) and putting on their heads a long and high crowned Hat, whereon a man is painted burning in the Fire, with many Devils about him plying him with Fire and Faggot; thus are they led away to the ſtake to be burned, with a cloven ſtick upon their Tongues to hinder them from ſpeaking any thing: This meaſure, Mr. <hi>Nicholas Burton;</hi> (Merchant of <hi>London</hi>) met with in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s days.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe Fifth Character of the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the Novelty of it, for which it ought to be abhorred: The Romaniſts do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (but unjuſtly impeach us of Novelty,) which (in truth) is their own Crime. The Maxim is <hi>[Actori, non Reo incumbit probatio]</hi> the Plaintiff that affirms, not the Defendant that denyes, ſhould prove his Plea; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of our Novelty, we defend our Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they do ſcornfully call us Novellers, and ask where our Religion was before <hi>Luther;</hi> we anſwer, our Religion was always in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, where their Religion could never be found: We can look beyond <hi>Luther,</hi> even to the true Catholick and Apoſtolical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, wherewith ours holds conſonancy in all points; but their brags and boaſtings of Antiquity is no better than that Cheat which the Gibeonites put upon <hi>Iſrael, with their old Shooes and mouldy Bread, Joſh.</hi> 9.5. As they did <hi>work wilily,</hi> teaching their Tongues to lye, and covering their Falſhood with Rags of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even ſo do the Romaniſts in our day with their <hi>old Shooes</hi> and <hi>clouted,</hi> with <hi>their old Sacks,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95838:72"/>old Bottles,</hi> and <hi>old Garments,</hi> to delude the World with their lying Doctrines; for when they are put to prove the Antiquity of their Religion, they can go no higher than about a thouſand years ago; and ſuch an upſtart Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal as this, made great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to deride Arrianiſm (the elder Siſter to Antichriſtianiſm) for its Novelty, becauſe it had no higher a Riſe than in ſuch an Emperors Reign: <hi>[non erat ſic ab initio] It was not ſo from the beginning, Matth.</hi> 19.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a Romiſh Scoff, that <hi>Turkeys, Hops, and Hereſie came into</hi> England <hi>all together in one bottom,</hi> to wit, when <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>'s Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible</hi> were brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as if no ſuch Man as bleſſed <hi>Wickliff</hi> (with many other faithful Witneſſes to the Truth) had ever been heard of, and as if the Writings of that holy Martyr, <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> had never been brought hither, and wrought much good here above an hundred years before <hi>Luther</hi>'s time; and might not the mockers of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion take up the ſame Taunt againſt the godly Jews after the great defection in their Captivity of Literal <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Where was your Religion before</hi> Ezra? and <hi>where was your Church before him?</hi> It might have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered then, Our Religion is in the word of God, in the five Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but our Church hath been in the bondage of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from which God hath mercifully delivered it by his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95838:72"/>Servant <hi>Ezra:</hi> So we may anſwer, Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath been ever in Gods holy Word, and will ever remain ſo; but our Church hath been in the Bondage of <hi>Babylon</hi> Myſtical, (as they of <hi>Babylon</hi> Literal) which the Lord hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering out of this many Years, by many of his Servants in many Ages: Yea, and might not the Scribes and Phariſees have made the ſame Objection againſt our Lord Chriſt (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) and his Goſpel for an upſtart Religion: This is well Anticipated, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7. <hi>This is the old Commandment which was from the beginning.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95838:73"/>of ſuch as had from time to time profeſſed that ſame Religion which he preached (ſo contrary to theirs) to his own time. Had they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this, Chriſt muſt have confeſſed to them that for the laſt three hundred years <hi>at the leaſt,</hi> no ſuch Succeſſion could be demonſtrated; and yet our Lord rectifies the Extravagancies of thoſe blind Guides, by reducing them to the firſt Inſtitution (which is the beſt Rule of all right Reformations) telling them <hi>that from the beginning it was not ſo, Matth.</hi> 19.8. Yea and the beloved Diſciple (which lay in Chriſts Boſom) ſeems ſtudiouſly to decline all ſuſpicion of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in ſaying; <hi>I write unto you no new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7. as if he would have us to have a jealous eye upon new Notions, ſeeing Truth is like Wine, <hi>the Older the Better.

Yea ſo anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that though it was made by <hi>Canetias</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Artificer as Records relate, yet for the great Antiquity of it, thoſe covetous and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Prieſts gave out, that it did <hi>fall down from</hi> Jupiter, to make it the more venerable amongſt the blind Heathens, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.35. And by a craft not much unlike this of thoſe Pagan Craftsmen, the Papagan or Popiſh Prieſts do
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95838:75"/>now ſhew ſome ſhivers of the Croſs whereon our Lord ſuffered, yea ſome ſhreds of the tale of the Aſs, whereupon he rode to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> To go yet higher, ſinning and lying are anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things, as ancient almoſt as the world; yet are they not the better but worſe for this Antiquity; neither doth Chriſt hereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Devil in calling him a <hi>Murtherer from the beginning, John</hi> 8.44. All ancient things are not the beſt things.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to come cloſer to the point, and to ſhew that the Romiſh Religion is ſo far from any true Antiquity, that it is no better than a Novice, Novelty, and a mere Innovation, and therefore the charge of Novelty the Romaniſts would faſten upon us, ought (indeed) to be retorted upon them; they do craſtily to call <hi>[Novellers]</hi> firſt, and it may be they learn'd this craft from <hi>Ahab</hi> (that ſold himſelf to work wickedly) who firſt called the Lords Prophet <hi>[Atroubler of Iſrael,]</hi> but the Prophet retorts it back upon him ſaying, <hi>Thou and thy Fathers houſe be the troublers of Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.17. or rather, the Romaniſts might learn this craft from <hi>Korah</hi> and his Conſpirators, that accuſed <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron for taking too much upon them,</hi> when indeed it was their own Crime; and therefore 'twas juſtly charged (by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion) upon them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> what they had unjuſtly charged upon him and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 16.3, 7. And thus our retorting upon Popery
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95838:75"/>the charge of Novelty wherewith the Papiſts falſely reflect upon us, is warranted by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And here I cannot omit how <hi>Scaliger</hi> truly and trimly told the Jeſuits, <hi>[Nos non ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Novatores, ſed vos eſtis Veteratores.]</hi> we are not <hi>young Novellers,</hi> but ſure I am; <hi>you are old Cheaters.</hi> The truth of this learned mans Teſtimony will be more evident in handling the Jeſuits tricks in <hi>Chapter</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Novelty of Popery appeareth in the ſequel more particularly, although we be able (as hath been ſaid) to look far beyond <hi>Luther,</hi> yet ſure I am, the Romaniſts (in their preſent faith) cannot look beyond Antichriſt, I mean the Weſtern Antichriſt, the Pope. Aſſuredly Popery roſe not until the <hi>Star [Wormwood]</hi> fell, which was not till the third Angel ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.10. which muſt be after that great flood of Arrianiſm, that ſeemed to drown the World again, inſomuch that the good Father cryed out <hi>totus mundus fit Arrianus.</hi> Now this <hi>great Star,</hi> blazing Comet, or burning Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, muſt needs be that grand Apoſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Phocas</hi> (the Parricide) ſet up in his Chair of Peſtilence, and this <hi>great Star</hi> is called <hi>[Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood]</hi> not only becauſe he was in the Gall of Bitterneſs himſelf, but alſo becauſe he imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered others, and proved exceeding bitter to others: He was the Son of Perdition (ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) both Actively and Paſſively, in working the deſtruction of others, and being for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

               <p n="10">10.

To which I anſwer, 'twas not men of the Popiſh but of the Chriſtian Religion, that did moſt of thoſe things. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> built a Church on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> built another at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and our <hi>Ethelbert</hi> built <hi>Paul</hi>'s here at <hi>London.</hi> Theſe were all done before the fall of the Star <hi>[Wormwood,]</hi> or before <hi>Popery</hi> was heard of in the World, and before the man of Sin (that miſtery of Iniquity) was revealed.

               <p n="13">13. Moreover, if we conſider either the name or the thing, the Novelty hereof will be more evident. 1. Conſider the name <hi>[Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt]</hi> 'tis but a novel name, and not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients. What need any further Teſtimony of this, when their own Father
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95838:79"/>
                  <hi>Briſtow</hi> doth confeſs it; ſaying (in his eighth Demand) that the name <hi>[Papiſt]</hi> was never heard of till the time of Pope <hi>Lee,</hi> in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundredth year of Chriſt: <hi>Habemus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Confitentem,</hi> 'tis enough. The Teſtimony of an Adverſary againſt himſelf is unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Secondly, Conſider the thing <hi>[Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry]</hi> in its Popiſh Points; which are all novel Points, and not known to the ancient Church. We are able to ſhew the firſt Authors of their corrupt Doctrines, which were not received into the Church for ſix hundred years after Chriſt: and, though we could not do this, yet would it not follow that the Romiſh Church is the true ancient Church. For, firſt, Many Hereſies did ſpring up after the Apoſtles time, yet none knew how, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18. and 4.1. yea, Popery (it ſelf) <hi>began to work</hi> at that time, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. Secondly, The Head of ſome Errors may be as hard to diſcover as the Head of the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Satan (that Super-Seminator) ſows his Tares <hi>in the night, while men ſlept, Mat.</hi> 13.15.

But, above all, that Grand Error of Popery (in as much as it is called a <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi>) was foiſted in leſs diſcernably. Thirdly, The Romaniſts themſelves do acknowledge, that there are many Errors crept into the Church, the firſt Authors whereof cannot be named.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95838:79"/>And Fourthly, It would be enough to diſcover the Novelty of Popery, by demonſtrating that it cannot be found in the Holy Scriptures, which is the trueſt Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I have already diſcovered the Novelty of many Popiſh Points of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in <hi>pag.</hi> 26. <hi>Paragraph.</hi> 65, 66. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this Treatiſe. That they were not from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but are all additions by the man of ſin, and therefore accurſed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18. My Additions therefore thereunto ſhall be ſuch only, as my brevity propoſed can admit; to ſay but little to their inferior practick Points; as of their Popiſh Beads, Holy Water, Miſſal Veſtments, Latin Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. The uſe of their Beads in their blind devotion, came not from <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but from <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Hermit,</hi> that Trumpet to the Holy War (ſo called) who taught them the manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Beads, that thereby they might rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon their Prayers: as if God ſhould be verily in their Debt, for their ſo many <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave Maries;</hi> whereas true Devotion is not ſo much <hi>[Numeranda ut Ponderanda] num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered as pondered</hi> with the Lord: he will have weight and worth in right Prayer, and not <hi>Vain babbling, Mat.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Battilogia Pentificia vel ipſum Satanam pudeat.</hi> Their vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſo groſs and ſhameleſs, that the Devil himſelf (had he any ſhame in him) would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of them, faith learned <hi>Beza.</hi> 2. Their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95838:80"/>Holy Water <hi>Polidor Virgil</hi> makes Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the firſt to be its Author, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 118, or 121. ſee <hi>Prideaux</hi> his Introduction, <hi>pag.</hi> 69. I confeſs they may go to <hi>Nama Pompilius</hi> and other Heathens, for conſecrated Water (long before this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>) for they had their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> at their Idol-Temple doors; and their <hi>Baronius</hi> alledges <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s ſixth <hi>Satyr</hi> for their Luſtral Water. Surely this is not an Antiquity for the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to boaſt of, to borrow from Devil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It muſt not be denied that if their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Water be derived from <hi>Numa Pompilins,</hi> it hath Antiquity in it, becauſe <hi>Numa</hi> was ſeven hundred years before Chriſt; a good Warrant for Chriſtian Holy Water: and in nothing better than in this, that <hi>Numa</hi> was a reputed Conjurer, and ſo a fitter Author of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Water: It is truly called ſo from their own form of conſecrating this Holy Water; which is as followeth [I conjure thee, O thou Creature, Water, in the Name of God † the Father Almighty, and in the Name of Jeſus † Chriſt the Son, and by the power of the Holy † Spirit] with certain Prayers mumbled over it; then they blaſphemouſly equal it to the blood of Chriſt for purging away ſins, you may ſuppoſe 'tis only ſuch Sins as have no deep rooting in us, that a few drops of this Holy Water can waſh away. I wonder they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95838:80"/>ſhould overlook that <hi>Holy Water</hi> mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.17. there's Antiquity indeed, (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Baronius</hi>'s ſixth Satyr of <hi>Juvenal. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Annal. ann.</hi> 44.) but the miſchief is, that was an Holy Water <hi>that cauſed the Curſe, Num.</hi> 5.21. Water is indeed an Element that God hath given us, both for Natural and Celeſtial uſe: the firſt in Houſehold Affairs, the ſecond in the Sacrament of Baptiſm: <hi>theſe are truly ancient things;</hi> but the Romaniſts converting it (beyond all Divine Ordination) by their Exorciſms and Inchantments, to other Magick and Idolatrous Uſes: This is a mere Novelty and Nullity. The words of their Exorciſms run thus <hi>[Exorcizo te Aqua Benedicta, ut fias aqua exercizata, &amp;c.]</hi> that thou maiſt have power to drive away Devils. Oh ridiculous. Much more might I ſay to this point, but my Book (intended little) ſwelleth much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p n="16">16. So I muſt be abrupt in it, as likewiſe, 3. In their Miſſal Veſtments, wherein they do plainly <hi>Judaize;</hi> yea, more than ſo, or rather <hi>Heathenize</hi> it therein: For, 1. They cannot plead the Garments of the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſeeing this were to ſend the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> School, and ſo to deny that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, <hi>Which is the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3. for Chriſt, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, changed the Law of the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11. and, together with it, the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95838:81"/>Rites and Apparels; which glittering Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could not congruouſly correſpond with the <hi>Simplicity of the Goſpel.</hi> 2. Popiſh Prieſts do more than Judaize, in as much as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more in their Holy Garments than ever the Moſaical Prieſts did; for the High Prieſts had but ſeven Garments appointed them, and the other Prieſts but two; yet the Popiſh Prieſts have ſix, their Popiſh Prelates nine more, <hi>Ration.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The Sixth Property, Its Inconſiſtency with Publick Peace.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THere is a three-fold Inconſiſtency that the Romiſh Religion hath as a remark upon it: As 1. Its Inconſiſtency <hi>with holineſs to God,</hi> as it both allows of and wallows in a moſt impure worſhip, which is both <hi>contrary to his Holy Nature,</hi> in their downright Idolatry; by Adoration of Images, and Invocation of Saints and Angels; and <hi>contrary to his holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> in the very Letter of it, by their ſetting up another Head beſides <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they rob of all his Offices, Regal, Sacerdotal, and Prophetical; by eſtabliſhing Free-will, Merit, Sins (in their own nature) <hi>Venial,</hi> and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to</hi> and diminiſhing <hi>from</hi> the Word of God in many points, as in their ſeven Sacraments, and other parts of Popery; yea generally the whole Syſtem and Body of it (as ſuch) being fully contradictory to the Scripture of Truth, as my Second Part doth plainly demonſtrate.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95838:84"/>(2.) Its Inconſiſtency <hi>with Righteouſneſs to Man,</hi> by its accounting all of any other Religions, Hereticks, and that Faith is not to be kept with ſuch as they account ſo; alſo that force and violence (ſuch as is uſed in their bloody Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions) yea and death it ſelf may be inflicted upon thoſe they call Hereticks, and that mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>[quà tales] for their being ſuch,</hi> though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they do nothing either in word or deed, either to diſturb the Peace or juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the powers of thoſe Popiſh Countries wherein they live, ſee Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>large Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, fol.</hi> 90. and 231. Popery lays ſuch barbarous Obligations upon every Papiſt, that he holds himſelf bound to kill any Son of <hi>Adam</hi> whom he pleaſeth to term an Heretick, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God, of Nature, and of Nations: How can this be conſiſtent with <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. (3.) Its Inconſiſtency with publick peace and common ſafety in States and Kingdoms, (to ſay no more of the two former Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) is the main matter I would here demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; and that by diſcovering how the very Principles intrinſecally eſſential to Popery, are all of ſuch dangerous Influence and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, (which their Religion binds them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) by reaſon whereof, no Proteſtant State or Kingdom (wherein Popiſh Prieſts and people live) can be ſecure from diſturbance by them, or yet ought to truſt to the Loyalty of ſuch,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95838:84"/>as (by the very Religion they profeſs) may lawfully be diſloyal when they pleaſe; yea and not only <hi>may be,</hi> but <hi>muſt be</hi> diſloyal, being bound to be ſo when they are able and have advantage. Upon this very conſideration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it was, that our own learned Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> in his ſeventeenth Queſtion determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that Jeſuitiz'd Papiſts cannot poſſibly be good Subjects; ſaying: <hi>[Non eſſe, extra contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſiam eſt, &amp;c.]</hi> That they <hi>are</hi> not ſo 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Controverſie, for their many hainous Conſpiracies againſt Kings and Kingdoms do make a clear demonſtration. But (ſaith he) all the queſtion is, ſeeing 'tis plain they are not) whether they can be good Subjects; in as much as their very Principles which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites have impoſed, and which all Jeſuitiz'd Papiſts have received, do neceſſarily hinder them from being ſo: Whoever therefore he be that owns the Jeſuits Principles, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve them but alſo improve them by drawing thoſe Principles into practice; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be of the Clergy or Laity (ſaith he) ſuch a one can by no means ſo much as have the very name of a good Subject: Let us now take a view particularly of their Principles which are <hi>Inconſiſtent with Peace.</hi> Their 1. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is, <hi>Their owning of and acting by a Foreign Power, and diſowning Subjection to the power of their Native Princes.</hi> This dogmatical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (alone) makes all Romaniſts (eſpecially
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95838:85"/>their Prieſts and Jeſuits) to be ſo far uncapable of being numbred amongſt good Subjects, as that they cannot be ſo much as reckoned as Subjects at all; in as much as they hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exempted from all ſecular Powers, and to be Subjects to none but to their holy Father the Pope, quite contrary to the Doctrine of the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. [<hi>Let every Soul</hi> (whether Clergy or Laity) <hi>be ſubject to the higher Powers:</hi> Surely <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> could not mean the higher powers of the Roman Pope, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Their great Champion <hi>[Bellarmine]</hi> pleads this Exemption for his Romiſh Clergy; ſaying, <hi>[They are not obliged to Civil Laws by any Coactive, but only by a directive Obligation,] Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. de Cler. lib.</hi> 1. Againſt this Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> acutely anſwereth: But, <hi>What if they will not be directed, but trample the Civil Laws under their Feet?</hi> Bellarmine replies, <hi>They cannot</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) <hi>be puniſh'd by the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi>] Our Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> goes further, ſaying: <hi>But what if they commit that grand wickedneſs of High Treaſon?</hi> To this <hi>Eudaemon</hi> the Jeſuit rejoyns ſaying, <hi>That Clergymen cannot properly commit Treaſon,</hi> and their <hi>Zimanca</hi> expreſly teacheth, <hi>that a Clergy-mans Rebellion is not properly High Treaſon, for he is not ſubject to the King.</hi> By this they cut the very ſinews of all Political Laws, while they plead this exemption from the Yoke of all ſecular Power, and hereby 'tis manifeſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95838:85"/>they are ſo far from being good Subjects, that they do profeſs themſelves no Subjects at all by this Exemption. This is quite contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 1. Of holy <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13.12, 4. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Lex (aut E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium) non diſtinguit, ibi non eſt diſtinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>[Let every Soul be ſubject]</hi> without any diſtinction, why do they make diſtinctions where God makes none; as if the <hi>Generation</hi> of a <hi>Clerick</hi> were the <hi>Corruption</hi> of a <hi>Subject:</hi> (in this Exemption) what is this but to make the Church to deſtroy the State? If the Magiſtrate be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> ordained of God to puniſh Evil Doers (as this Apoſtle affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;) then Popiſh Clericks that are Evil Doers can (in no wiſe) be exempted from his Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, unleſs they do not acknowledge God (the Ordainer of that Power) to be a <hi>Superior Power to theirs.</hi> 2. Of Holy <hi>Peter</hi> (their own pretended Head,) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to Kings and Governours. Chryſoſtom</hi> ſhews, that this Command is to all Clergymen, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the very Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; and were it not ſo, it would be a loſs unto Princes to have any of their Subjects become Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if thereby he ſhould loſe that ſubjection which was due to him before. But oppoſite to this, is that excellent Note which <hi>Zanchy</hi> (that Magazine of Learning) gives in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Dedicatory to his <hi>Miſcelanea.</hi> In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt this is wonderful, that he Wills
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95838:86"/>and Commands all Princes and Potentates to be ſubject to his Kingdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9, 11, 12. And yet he Wills and Commands likewiſe, that his Kingdom be ſubject to the Kingdoms of the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As this Principle of exemption is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Doctrine 1. Of Holy <hi>Paul,</hi> and 2. Of Holy <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo 3. Of the Holy, Holy, Holy Chriſt; who Preached up that Doctrine of <hi>Rendring to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that were</hi> Caeſar's, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.21. 'Tis obſervable, that not only the Mother of our Lord (though big bellied, and ſo might have pleaded Exemption) goes up to the Chief City to be taxed by <hi>Caeſar, Luke</hi> 2.1, 3, 4. but alſo our Lord himſelf (who might (above all) have pleaded his own freedom) paid his Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that ſo <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould not think the Goſpel to be a contradiction to his Government, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. Yea, and at the laſt our Lord Chriſt delivered up his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> without any words of derogation concerning their power over him, <hi>John</hi> 19.10, 11. 'Tis likewiſe Remarkable, that Holy <hi>Paul</hi> made his Appeal from a corrupt Eccleſiaſtick Court at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to know God) unto an Heatheniſh Civil Court at <hi>Rome</hi> (which knew not the Lord,) yea and that not only in Civil, but in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Affairs or Offences, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.8, 9, 10. For, ſaith he, <hi>neither againſt the Law of the Jews, nor againſt the Temple,</hi> (thoſe were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95838:86"/>of Religion) <hi>nor yet againſt</hi> Caeſar <hi>have I offended any thing.</hi> Juſt contrary do the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, ſurely <hi>Paul</hi> had never Appealed to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> had he not believed that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a Civil Power over him: But theſe men Appeal from the Civil to the Eccleſiaſtick Power, and from their own Native or Natural Prince or <hi>Caeſar</hi> to their King (<hi>Abaddon, Revel.</hi> 9.11.) at <hi>Rome,</hi> in which laſt Circumſtance of Place only, they do correſpond with the Apoſtles Appeal, both being made to <hi>Rome:</hi> And that you may not want a Royal Witneſs to theſe things, King <hi>James</hi> (in his learned Premonition to all Kings, free Princes and States of Chriſtendom) tells them, that this very Principle exempts almoſt the third part of their Subjects from that ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they owe to them in temporal matters, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. Shewing alſo, how the very Laity (that are poiſoned with their Jeſuitical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) may plead this Exemption, and make their Appeals from their lawful Soveraign to that Foreign Power of the Pope, and ſo be no longer obedient than till they be fully furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power ſufficient to reſiſt and rebel, <hi>p.</hi> 115, 117, 121.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Royal Witneſs (aforeſaid) lays great ſtreſs upon this Jeſuitical Principle, <hi>which makes all the Kings in Chriſtendom to be mere Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to the Pope;</hi> As if <hi>[Feed my Sheep]</hi> gave him ſo ample a power over Kings as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne

The ſecond peſtilent Principle of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which makes it Inconſiſtent with publick Peace, (next to their owning of a foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is enough inſolent over Princes and Peaſants) is this; <hi>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> This is ſuch a poiſonful Poſition, that at one ſtroke it cuts in pieces all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sinews of Humane Society, and all recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal duties betwixt Natural, Civil, or Religious Relations; they are altogether ſtrangled at once hereby. Unworthily is that called a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which ſignifies a binding to duty) that at one blow plainly unties all duties taught

               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding all the endeavours of former and latter Reconcilers, yet there is ſuch a [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] or <hi>great Gulf fixed,</hi> (as that in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25.) by the <hi>unmovable</hi> and <hi>immutable decree of God</hi> betwixt Papiſts and Proteſtants, as there is 'twixt <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> 'twixt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> ſo that no Bridge of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be made over it. Not unlike to that vaſt hollowneſs of the Valleys, betwixt thoſe exceeding high Mountains (that <hi>Cambden</hi> ſpeaks of) in <hi>Merionethſhire</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> whoſe hanging tops come ſo cloſe together, that Shepherds can audibly talk together from the tops of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95838:99"/>them, and yet will it be a days Journy before they can meet perſonally to embrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus, upon ſound and ſolid ſearch ſuch will be found that grand diſtance and remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 'twixt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> (how nere ſoever they ſeem to be repreſented, by the falſe glaſſes of our Reconcilers, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Accommodation) that they can never be rightly Reconciled no more than <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod and the Magicians Rods, until the former of <hi>the Rods have ſwallowed up the latter, Exod.</hi> 7.12. The real Rod did ſwallow up the ſeeming ones, and the true Chriſtian Religion will ſwallow up the Romiſh, (that only ſeems to be Chriſtian but is indeed Antichriſtian, a mere deluſion and Phantaſm) as Chriſt <hi>ſwallowed up ſin and death in victory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. And though <hi>De Clara, Grotius, Caſſander,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do ſeem to make fair proffers, yet theſe be more of the nature of <hi>Baits</hi> than <hi>Gifts,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeeing they have no Commiſſion from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to treat; and therefore, (ſhould their Offers be accepted as ſome would gladly do) yet the Romiſh Church would not look upon her ſelf as bound to pay their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               <p n="4">4. 'Tis therefore no better than a <hi>labour in vain,</hi> to undertake any Reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> who will have either all or nothing: If not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> abhors all Accommodations. Hence ſome of great Reading and Judgment doubt not to ſay, that our late Civil (uncivil) Wars, were promoted by the Popes Influence, merely for <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Project</hi> of Reconcilement that then was on foot; for had that deſign been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Pope (who will have all and will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, <hi>the way of Peace he knows not</hi> and hates) would have been ſafe no where: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not improbably ſaid further, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was wickedly murther'd by the Popes Inſtigation, leſt he and the French King, together with <hi>Chriſtiana</hi> (Queen of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>) ſhould have conſtrained the Pope (by means of ſuch an Accommodation endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to have lour'd his Top-Sail. In fine, 'tis as unpracticable to Reconcile them as it is to Reconcile God and <hi>Baal,</hi>

               <p n="9">9. The ſecond Argument, <hi>Our running from</hi> Rome (and not our running to it in plauſible Reconciliation) <hi>is our duty;</hi> 'tis our Obedience to Gods Call and Command, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Run out of her my people, and partake not of her Sins, leſt ye alſo partake of her Plagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>[Eſto procul Româ qui cupis eſſe Pius.]</q>
               <p>Flee from this Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> as you would a Peſthouſe; the cauſe of our running from <hi>Rome</hi> lyeth (ſaith learned <hi>Perkins</hi>) in her ſelf, namely the Cup of Fornication and of all Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that the Whore holds in her hand, <hi>Perk Prolog.</hi> to his <hi>Reformed Catholick.</hi> To this a Cloud of Witneſſes might be added, all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly holding out <hi>that this is our duty,</hi> and that upon <hi>pain of Damnation:</hi> ſee <hi>Wootton</hi>'s <hi>Run from Rome</hi> at large. The Command of God is upon us in reſpect to this Myſtical <hi>Sodom</hi> (as was upon <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.17.) <hi>Look not back or behind thee, neither tarry in all the Plain, but flee for thy Life.</hi> Alas! thoſe Reconcilers both look behind them and loiter in the plains of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in their Caſſandrian Enterpriſes; <hi>and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95838:104"/>therefore may juſtly expect to be turned into Pillars of everlaſting Shame and Obloquy,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife. The third Argument in ſhort is, <hi>[that played loth to depart] ſhe turned her</hi> about and ſhe was turned, ſo may they be; we muſt neither <hi>turn towards them</hi> nor <hi>return to them;</hi> for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God is upon us that was upon <hi>Jeremiah</hi> [<hi>Let them Return to thee but do not thou return to them, Jer.</hi> 15.19.] Now Conformity (in ſome caſes) is certainly the Chriſtians duty, <hi>Be not Conformed to this World, Rom.</hi> 12.2. That is, to the corrupt Cuſtoms and Courſes of it, yea and in ſuch caſes as Gods Prophet ſtood in, God will not have him to Chime in with Idolaters as the falſe Prophets did, but, ſaith the Lord, let them Conform to thee, and do not thou Conform to them; no nor meet them in the half way as our Reconcilers do. The fourth Argument, we may <hi>not halt betwixt two Opinions, 'twixt God and Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.21. <hi>How long will ye halt, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe halters ſprung from halting <hi>Jacob,</hi> that halted upon <hi>his Thigh as he paſſed over</hi> Penuel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.31.

               <p n="10">10. The fifth Argument, <hi>The Ark and</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon <hi>cannot ſtand together;</hi> the Philiſtins <hi>brought the Ark of God into the Houſe of</hi> Dagon, <hi>and ſet it by</hi> Dagon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, 2. Behold, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was faln upon his Face, &amp;c. v.</hi> 3, 4. As if he had been bowing to the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> as if he had heard the Pſalmiſts, <hi>[Worſhip him all ye Gods,]</hi> they endeavour their Conſiſtency the ſecond time, and then <hi>Dagon</hi>'s fall was more fatal. He breaks off his Head the Seat of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Hands the Seat of Power, and then he lyes upon the Threſhold to be troden under Foot, (by his Worſhippers at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Temple) as if no better worth, being unſavory Salt and a Dunghil Deity, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Surely they wanted the wiſdom of our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilers to ſtudy out ſome handſom Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and not have ſaid, <hi>[The Ark of God ſhall not abide with us, v.</hi> 7.] They might have taken up the Controverſie, and never have cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed [<hi>What ſhall we do with the Ark of God? v.</hi> 8.] They would have taught it the <hi>Rule of good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip;</hi> but aſſuredly, had thoſe Philiſtins hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily hit upon ſaying, [Away with <hi>Dagon</hi>] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of [Away with the Ark] and ſaid to their Idols [<hi>Get ye hence, Iſa.</hi> 30.22. <hi>What have we any more to do with</hi> Dagon, that cannot ſave himſelf much leſs us.] They had been wiſer
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95838:105"/>than our Reconcilers that will keep both. The ſixth Argument is, <hi>We ſhould not be unequally Yoked,</hi> (as aforeſaid) for what <hi>Fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſs with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs?</hi> and what <hi>Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? And what Concord hath Chriſt with</hi> Belial? Or what part hath he <hi>that believeth with an Infidel?</hi> And what <hi>Agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. Theſe are the Apoſtles ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queſtions, all which he implicitely anſwers in the Negative, as appears by his Inference, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Wherefore come out,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from among them, and be ye ſeparate and touch not the unclear thing, and I will receive you,</hi> and I will be a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you,</hi> and ye <hi>ſhall be my Sons and Daughters</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord Almighty, v.</hi> 18. But thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Reconcilers (as if they had a knack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bleſſed Apoſtle, yea a reach above the only Wiſe God himſelf) do cry [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] with <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as if they had found out the <hi>Arcanum</hi> or deep myſtery ('tis ſurely of Iniquity) to anſwer all thoſe Apoſtolical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in the Affirmative, having invented an Art (diabolical no doubt,) whereby to make an happy Compoſition of things diametrically, contrary, notwithſtanding the Philoſopher's Maxim, <hi>[Contraria ſeſe mutuò expellunt a ſuo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepibili]</hi> Contraries cannot conſiſt together at the ſame time in the ſame Subject: They can do Impoſſibles by their God Almighty the Pope above the True God, and have found out
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95838:105"/>the North Eaſt paſſage to the Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> a ſhorter way to get into Gods Boſom as Sons and Daughters, than ever either the Apoſtle (though wrap'd up to the third Heaven) or God himſelf thought of; and ſo it is indeed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The ſeventh Argument (as the other following) I ſhall not thus enlarge upon, ſeeing this Tractate (intended only as a little Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) ſwells beyond expectation: 'Tis this, if Chriſt ſay, <hi>Every Plant that the Father hath not Planted ſhall be plucked up;</hi> then Reconcilers ought not to eſtabliſh ſuch Plants (by ſeeking to twiſt Truth with Falſhood) yea and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them into our Native Soil, which hath been either too hot or too cold for that South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Plant: Chriſt ſaith ſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.13. and Popery is ſo, is obvious to every man that hath his Eyes opened with Chriſts Eye-ſalve; God never planted it by his Divine Inſtitution, nor watered it by his Divine Benediction; 'tis not <hi>the Planting of the Lord, a Tree of Righteouſneſs, Iſa.</hi> 61-3. but 'tis rather of the Devil's Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Watering, which never proſpered in any Land without being watered with the Blood of Saints and Hereticks. The eighth Argument, If <hi>John</hi> (divinely Inſpired) called <hi>Rome</hi> aright, a <hi>Whore,</hi> a <hi>great Whore,</hi> as if <hi>[Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrix Meretriciſſima]</hi> worſe than <hi>Thais, Lais, Phryne, Meſſalina,</hi> or Pope <hi>Joun</hi> her ſelf, (whom God permitted to Climb that Chair when the Popes were moſt buſie to ſubject the Kings of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95838:106"/>the Earth (as Vaſſals) to the Triple Crown, that he might point out to them this Mother of Harlots) <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.15. Then <hi>this holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church</hi> (ſo called in the ſame ſenſe that Hebrews call Harlots holy) muſt have a <hi>Bill of Divorce, Hoſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1. and not a <hi>Diploma</hi> for <hi>Reconcilement:</hi> The Sons of that Church ſhould plead with their Mother, <hi>[Quae gremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um nemini claudit]</hi> (which opens to all that will be her Paramours, and let her ſit upon their Conſciences) to put away her Whoredoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reconciliation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1, 20, 22. She muſt <hi>firſt Repent,</hi> and then (with God) <hi>you may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth Argument, <hi>If Babylon be fallen,</hi> as certainly it is in Gods decree, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.2. and that with a <hi>double Fall;</hi> then 'tis both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unſeaſonable for any Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to lend their Shoulders for ſupporting that which God will have to fall, <hi>who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his Will, Rom</hi> 9.19. <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall <hi>certò, citò, &amp; penitùs,</hi> certainly, ſpeedily, utterly: Their own Jeſuits, <hi>Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Corn. a Lapide,</hi> confeſs it: Yea <hi>Cotton</hi> the Jeſuit acknowledges 'tis now falling, for (he ſaith) the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is incomparably leſs than it was, and that how their Catholick Church is but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith alſo, that ever ſince the Pope hath been called Antichriſt, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been loſing ground as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Yea, 'tis evident what a cold Sweat lyes

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. To thoſe Scripture Arguments I might add many more had I room for it. As the tenth Argument.
